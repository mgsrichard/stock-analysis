# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of our second challenge is to refactor, or rework, the code we constructed within the modules this week to be more efficient if it had to run with larger data files. Steve, our hypothetical client, wants a program that can run on larger datasets, or even the whole stock market. 

## Results

### Stock Market Analysis

The results of the stock anaysis itself are the same as in the module since we are using the same data set.  These selected "green stocks" had a strong year in 2017, with only one experiencing a negative return, and they had a bad year in 2018, with all but two of the stocks having a poor, sometimes terrifically bad year.   We should also note that there were two stocks, however, that had positive returns in both years.  "RUN" had a return of 5.5% in 2017 and 84.0% in 2018, so it had modestly good return in 2017 and amazingly good return in 2018.  "ENPH" performed extremely well in both years, with rates of return of 129.5% and 81.9% in 2017 and 2018 respectively.  If we were to recommend a single stock to purchase based only on this small data set of 12 stocks, the best stock is defintely "ENPH." At the same time, we should definitely caution Steve that the data indicates a large amount of volatility in these sorts of stocks in general, and we should always be careful before investing all our funds in a single place.  I would recomment a wider market analysis and more sorts of stocks to be included in their portfolio to balance out their return experience and insulate them a bit from the fluctuations inherent in investing in one single slice of the market. Below are the output tables with total volumes and annual rates of return for 2017 and 2018.
